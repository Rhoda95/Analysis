  ### Data cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting
   
   
### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What is the peak sales period?

  ### Data Analysis
  ```SQL
  SELECT * FROM table 1
  where condt. =2;
  ```

  ### Results/Findings
  The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1.	Companyâ€™s sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2.	Product category A is the best performing category in terms of sales and revenue
3.	Customer segment with high lifetime value (LIV) should be targeted for marketing efforts. 

### Recommendation
- Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high LIV customers effectively.

  ### Limitations
  I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue column because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then, we can still see that theirs is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
